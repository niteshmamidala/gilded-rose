# Gilded Rose

Code refactoring changes on https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

## Used TypeScript with Jest & PHP with PHPUnit

### Unit Test Cases include following scenarios,

- Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
- The Quality of an item is never negative
- “Aged Brie” actually increases in Quality the older it gets
- The Quality of an item is never more than 50
- “Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
- “Backstage passes”, like aged brie, increases in Quality as it’s SellIn value approaches; Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the concert
